/*Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3

Output: true */

Binary search algorithm :-

 low=0; high = length of matrix-1
 (1) while(low<=high)
        mid=(high+low)/2;

 (2)    if target = matrix[mid]; return (matrix[mid])
             value found;
 (3)    if target>matrix[mid]
            low=mid+1;
            else high=mid-1;
(4)     exit;
